# Work-Science-Training-Course-Repo
This Repo contains some of the work I did within the training progam and the outputs I created. 

Project 1: Explored relationships between farmers market and other Food Environment Atlas predictors across geographies. Includes: General Stat analysis, spread and outlier analysis, and data visuals.

Project 2: Analyzed and interpreted relationship between diabetes rates and other Food Environmental Atlas outcomes. Interpretation includes: Histogram, correlation matrix, detailed scatter plots, regression analysis, and more.

Project 3: Used Rest API to text mine and NLP from NIH National Library of Medicine PubChem journal articles for text analysis. Includes: Scraping, Prepping, and tokenizing text data.

Project 4: Used Food Environment Atlas dataset to conduct Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning for predict and match economic types of categorization depended on variable inputs. Includes: prepping data for machine learning for predictive categorization and PCA cluster, and K-NN analysis, visualizations of PCA and Scree Plot.

Capstone: Capestone focused on looking at grant application data from USDA AMS Grants Division LAMP programs and if grant acceptance rates are biased by state or region within the US. Includes: Calling from impala/Hue connector to pull data in, data cleaning and preparation, setting dummy variables and grouping data by region and states to include acceptance rate, application count, normalizing input variables by z-score, scatter plots and correlation matrix of normalized variables, exportation of data and visualized to be then utilized by Tableau program for dashboarding. Tableau Dashboarding to include: Dynamic descriptive stats, distribution of variables, scatter plots, k-means clustering, and OLS Regression output.
