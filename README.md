# Work-Science-Training-Course-Repo
This Repo contains some of the work I did within the training progam and the outputs I created. 


Project 1: Explored realtionships between farmers market and other Food Environment Atlas predictors across geographies. Includes: General Stat analysis, spread and outlier analysis, and data visuals. 


Project 2: Analyzed and interprited relatonship between diabetes rates and other Food Environmental Atlas outcomes. Interpritation includes: Histogram, correlaiton matrix, detailed scatter plots, regression analysis, and more. 


Project 3: Used Rest API to text mine and NLP from NIH National Library of Medicne PubChem journal articles for text analysis. Includes: Scraping, Prepping, and tokenizing text data. 


Project 4: Used Food Environment Atlas dataset to conduct Suporvised and Unsuporvised machine learning for predict and match eocnomic types of catgorization depended on variable inputs. Includes: prepping data for machine learning for predicted cateogrization and PCA cluster, and K-NN analysis, visualizations of PCA and Scree Plot. 


Capstone: Capestone focued on looking at grant application data from USDA AMS Grants Division LAMP programs and if grant acceptance rates are biased by state or region within the US. Includes: Calling from impala/Hue connector to pull data in, data cleaning and preparation, setting dummary viables and grouping data by region and states to include acceptance rate, applicaiton count, nomalizing input variables by z-score, scatter plots and correlation matrix of normalizaed variables, exportaton of data and visualzed to be then utilzied by Tableau program for dashboarding. Tableau Dashboarding to include: Dynamic descrptive stats, distribution of variabes, scatter plots, k-means clustering, and OLS Regression output.
